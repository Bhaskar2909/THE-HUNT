# THE-HUNT

## Statment Of Pupose

We would like to create a gaming application for NWMSU which works on iPhone SE, Android device, laptop and an iPad. The main motto behind this idea of creating a gaming application is to bring bearcats of diverse departments onto a common platform which helps students to interact, encourages students to unique and special parts of campus, contributes in developing an attitude towards teamwork.

## Overview

We would like to create an app that can be played on a mobile device. The app would encourage players to complete a 'quest' by encountering a specific list of locations. A player would activate one of the locations in the quest. To score that location, the user must enter the geographic area (as determined by their mobile device). Locations may be explicitly identified (easier) - or described using clues (harder). The quest may require locations to be accessed in a specific order - or in any order as specified by the quest creator.
