# THE-HUNT

## Statment Of Pupose

2020 has turned out to be an interesting year. We would like to create an outside, socially-distant game that:

* Encourages outside activity.
* Introduces Bearcats to unique and special parts of campus.
* Supports teamwork, while allowing players to remain safe.
* Could be an engaging icebreaker for various student organizations.

## Overview

We would like to create an app that can be played on a mobile device. The app would encourage players to complete a 'quest' by encountering a specific list of locations. A player would activate one of the locations in the quest. To score that location, the user must enter the geographic area (as determined by their mobile device). Locations may be explicitly identified (easier) - or described using clues (harder). The quest may require locations to be accessed in a specific order - or in any order as specified by the quest creator.
